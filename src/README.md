# Getting Set Up

For this tutorial you will need a testnet account.  If you do not have one go [here](https://wallet.testnet.near.org), using the email option is the easiest method for ensuring you can recover your account.

`raen` is a build tool for NEAR smart contracts.

With RAEN, you can:

* `build`: compile a contract, generate its Application Contract Interface (ACI), and inject it into a custom section of the contract's WebAssembly (Wasm) binary.
* `fetch` _[coming soon]_: use the ACI of a deployed contract to generate source code bindings for cross contract calls and client interfaces.

To get started, first [install RAEN](https://raen.dev/docs/guide/installation.html).

If you have experience with NEAR and want to get to the RAEN-specific stuff you can skip to the [status message contract](./status-message/wit.md).
