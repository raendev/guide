# Who is this for?

App developers.

If you're wondering what a blockchain even is or what effects it might have on the world, you can find lots of other introductions. Here's a [booster](https://martinhiesboeck.blog/2018/04/02/how-blockchain-will-save-the-world/), a [doomer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g), [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) [discussions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-dan-olson.html), and a [refreshingly neutral intro](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/cryptocurrency-crypto-guide.html).

If you want to know how blockchains work, there's lots of other introductions for that, too. You can learn about [Proof of Work](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/bitcoin) and [Proof of Stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) and read [lots](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) [of](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) [whitepapers](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/architecture/papers).

This guide sits in between such philosophical intros and nitty-gritty explainers.

If you want to learn how to actually _use_ a blockchain, this guide is for you. You'll get a gentle introduction to Rust, the [most-loved language for seven years running](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted), and a gentle introduction to NEAR.

This guide assumes you have experience with the command line and at least one programming language. That's it.

If you're already experienced with some other blockchain, you'll be able to go a bit faster through some parts.

If you already have experience with Rust, you can probably skip certain parts and just look for the NEAR-specific stuff.

If you're already experienced with Rust and NEAR, you probably don't need to stick around. Just go use RAEN. Have a great time!
